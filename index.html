								<h2>Testimonials</h2>
						
								<blockquote>Miss Indu is the best when it comes to taking care of my son. She is very sweet and takes her time to make sure that my son is playing but also learning. My son always tells me how great his day was at daycare. Being a busy mom, I was initially worried about my son not having a proper environment to learn and socialize, but Miss Indu and My Dear Daycare has proved to be the best daycare.
									I am able to have peace of mind knowing that my child is in great care.   - Disna H</blockquote>
									
								<blockquote>Ms Indu is a very kind and lovely person. Her house is very clean. She also has years of experience as a teacher. My son loved being there. I can work calmly knowing that my little one is in a safe place. - Juana G</blockquote>

								<blockquote>Miss Indu is so wonderful! She has been a blessing to our family. Miss Indu has been watching our son from 9months old to 3 years old, and she cared for him as if he were her own. Apart from the expected care and attention, she does educational activities and dedicated her time to making sure my child has the best environment to grow. She constantly stimulates young minds, while encouraging positive peer interactions. I am glad I am able to drop of my little one and not be worried. I recommend Miss Indu to anyone looking for a daycare. - Gabriela R</blockquote>
